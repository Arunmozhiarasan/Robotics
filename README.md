HOSPITAL AID BOT USING WEBOTS

The aim of this project is to develop an autonomous Hospital Aid bot using the Webots simulation environment, capable of navigating through the hospital corridor and visiting specific rooms according to a predefined sequence. Additionally, the project aims to use Webots to create robot prototypes, develop, test, and validate control algorithms. It also involves incorporating sensors that 
replicate real-time functionality to observe and analyze their performance in the simulation, ensuring 
the robot can operate effectively in real-world scenarios. 
The Hospital Aid Bot project focuses on simulating an autonomous robotic assistant within a hospital environment using the Webots simulation platform. The bot is programmed to navigate through hospital corridors and reach designated patient rooms following a predefined sequence. It mimics real-world scenarios of medical delivery and assistance by integrating path planning and obstacle avoidance algorithms. This simulation aids in demonstrating the potential of robotics in healthcare for tasks like medicine delivery, patient monitoring, and logistical support, thereby reducing the manual workload on hospital staff and enhancing operational efficiency.
